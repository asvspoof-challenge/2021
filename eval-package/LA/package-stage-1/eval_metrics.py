    Compute Tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF) [1] for a fixed ASV system.
    In brief, t-DCF returns a detection cost of a cascaded system of this form,

      Speech waveform -> [CM] -> [ASV] -> decision

    where CM stands for countermeasure and ASV for automatic speaker
    verification. The CM is therefore used as a 'gate' to decided whether or
    not the input speech sample should be passed onwards to the ASV system.
    Generally, both CM and ASV can do detection errors. Not all those errors
    are necessarily equally cost, and not all types of users are necessarily
    equally likely. The tandem t-DCF gives a principled with to compare
    different spoofing countermeasures under a detection cost function
    framework that takes that information into account.

    INPUTS:

      bonafide_score_cm   A vector of POSITIVE CLASS (bona fide or human)
                          detection scores obtained by executing a spoofing
                          countermeasure (CM) on some positive evaluation trials.
                          trial represents a bona fide case.
      spoof_score_cm      A vector of NEGATIVE CLASS (spoofing attack)
                          detection scores obtained by executing a spoofing
                          CM on some negative evaluation trials.
      Pfa_asv             False alarm (false acceptance) rate of the ASV
                          system that is evaluated in tandem with the CM.
                          Assumed to be in fractions, not percentages.
      Pmiss_asv           Miss (false rejection) rate of the ASV system that
                          is evaluated in tandem with the spoofing CM.
                          Assumed to be in fractions, not percentages.
      Pmiss_spoof_asv     Miss rate of spoof samples of the ASV system that
                          is evaluated in tandem with the spoofing CM. That
                          is, the fraction of spoof samples that were
                          rejected by the ASV system.
      cost_model          A struct that contains the parameters of t-DCF,
                          with the following fields.

                          Ptar        Prior probability of target speaker.
                          Pnon        Prior probability of nontarget speaker (zero-effort impostor)
                          Psoof       Prior probability of spoofing attack.
                          Cmiss       Cost of tandem system falsely rejecting target speaker.
                          Cfa         Cost of tandem system falsely accepting nontarget speaker.
                          Cfa_spoof   Cost of tandem system falsely accepting spoof.

      print_cost          Print a summary of the cost parameters and the
                          implied t-DCF cost function?

    OUTPUTS:

      tDCF_norm           Normalized t-DCF curve across the different CM
                          system operating points; see [2] for more details.
                          Normalized t-DCF > 1 indicates a useless
                          countermeasure (as the tandem system would do
                          better without it). min(tDCF_norm) will be the
                          minimum t-DCF used in ASVspoof 2019 [2].
      CM_thresholds       Vector of same size as tDCF_norm corresponding to
                          the CM threshold (operating point).

    NOTE:
    o     In relative terms, higher detection scores values are assumed to
          indicate stronger support for the bona fide hypothesis.
    o     You should provide real-valued soft scores, NOT hard decisions. The
          recommendation is that the scores are log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)
          from a bonafide-vs-spoof hypothesis based on some statistical model.
          This, however, is NOT required. The scores can have arbitrary range
          and scaling.
    o     Pfa_asv, Pmiss_asv, Pmiss_spoof_asv are in fractions, not percentages.
